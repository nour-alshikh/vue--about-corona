                        From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS,
                        including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt
                        protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The
                        best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your
                        hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid
                        infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.

                        Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body
